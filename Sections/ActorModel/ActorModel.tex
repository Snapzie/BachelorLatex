\section{Actor model}
The actor model is a programming model utilising concurrent computation for developing parallel, distributed and mobile systems. An actor can do three things: it can send messages to other actors, it can update its local state or it can create more actors. All actors work concurrently and asynchronously together by sending and receiving messages. When an actor receives a message it performs some specified task based on its local state and the content of the received message. This task can be to perform some computation, and the result can then be passed along to another actor in a new message \cite{ActorModelPaper}.\\
All actors have a globally unique name which is used to determine to which actor a message is sent. Name of actors may be communicated in messages such that an actor knows who to send the next message to, or such that an actor knows who just sent it a message. An actor's state is local and can not be shared with other actors, and thus, to change the behaviour of an actor, another actor must send a message specifying it to change state. The path a message takes and what network delays a message may encounter is not specified and thus messages may arrive out of order \cite{ActorModelPaper}.\\

As seen in \autoref{AMDemonstrated} an actor can be illustrated as an entity with a mailbox, a set of methods and a local state. The mailbox is often implemented as a queue \cite{ActorModelPaper}, and is used to store messages which arrive while the actor is already handling another message. The methods may make the actor change its state, make the actor create a new actor or send a message to another actor.\\
As already hinted at above, the core semantic properties of an actor are \textit{encapsulation} of the local state, the ability to \textit{atomically} execute methods, \textit{fairness} in scheduling actors and \textit{location transparency} to enable distributed execution and mobility \cite{ActorModelPaper}, and all of these we will look into next.
