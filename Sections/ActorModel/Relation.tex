\subsection{Relation to our work}
In our work we wished to build a distributed system which we later would decompose to a repository we could use to synthesize code. For this we used Orleans which greatly simplified the coding of this distributed system. By studying the actor model and Orleans we identified four 'critical points' which we foresaw to be big obstacles in synthesizing a distributed system. We identified \textit{timers} and \textit{disposing} of these as being crucial and system breaking if done wrong. \textit{Spawning of actors} as a standard task which would have to be possible and \textit{handling parameters} in a meta language as a difficult task, but a powerful tool for synthesis. These became the driving forces in our work, and we will later discuss how we handled each. \todo{Might need more work or rephrasing.}
