\subsection{Implementing Tests}
We have looked at how we built a repository of the adventure game in the section '\nameref{BuildRep}' and split it into pieces for the CLS. Here we will look at the same procedure of creating code, decomposing it and implementing it as combinators, just for the tests instead of the grains themselves. We want to be able to generate test cases that cover each of the game's variations, where only the needed tests are present in the variation, such that we can correctly test the variations, ensuring that they do indeed include the correct combinators and the game functions normally. \\
If we can synthesize testing with the CLS successfully, we should end up with the correct implementation of the grains and tests, such that all variations include thorough testing of their base implementation alongside tests specific to the current variation.
