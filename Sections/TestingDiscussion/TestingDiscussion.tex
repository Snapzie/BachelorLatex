\section{Testing Discussion}
In this section we will look closer on our implementation of the tests as combinator objects and how we use the CLS to create tests that conform to the specific variations of our grains. We will also look into some of the obstacles we ran into when creating tests and how we overcame, sidestepped or dealt with these. More precisely we will look into our testing in accordance with the CLS and the grains / actors.
